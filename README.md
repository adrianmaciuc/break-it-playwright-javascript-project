## Project Description
The purpose of this project is to polish our quality assurance automation skills on [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) and Javascript, as well as understanding and following best practices in workflows and coding.

## Playwright and JavaScript
This project utilizes [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), a tool for automating browsers, written in JavaScript. It allows us to perform end-to-end testing, mimicking user interactions and validating the behavior of web applications.

## Page Object Model Pattern
We follow the Page Object Model [(POM)](https://playwright.dev/docs/pom) pattern to maintain our tests. POM helps in creating an abstraction of the UI elements, making tests more maintainable and reducing duplication by separating page-specific locators and actions into reusable modules.
